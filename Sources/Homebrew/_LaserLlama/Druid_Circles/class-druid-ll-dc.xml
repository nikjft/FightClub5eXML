        <text>Deep in the unexplored jungles of the world, lizardfolk tribes are led by a fearsome Circle of Druids that worship ancient reptiles known as dinosaurs. Members of this Circle draw upon the memory of these ancient beasts that flows within their own blood to strike fear into the hearts of their foes.

Optional Rule: Reptilians Only
In many worlds, Druids who join the Circle of the Ancients are required to be of reptilian heritage. This would include the lizardfolk, tortles, saurians, some dragonborn, aaracokra, and other avians.

Talk to your DM about lifting this restriction for your world, or come up with a ritual or reason for your Druid to be considered of reptilian heritage.

When you use Wild Shape in this way, you transform into the Aberrant Form of that beast. You use the beast's normal stat block, but it gains the sunlight sensitivity trait (as below), and one additional trait of your choice from the following list:

Sunlight Sensitivity:
The beast has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and attack rolls that rely on sight when the beast, its target, or whatever it is attempting to perceive is in direct sunlight.

Amphibious Skin:
The beast's skin becomes completely translucent. It gains a swimming speed of 10 feet, and it can breathe air and water.

Arachnoid Grip:
The beast sprouts additional insectoid legs. It gains a 30 foot climbing speed, and it can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down, without needing to make an ability check.

Gnawing Hunger:
The beast grows serrated mouths at the end of each of its limbs. When it deals damage with a natural weapon attack, it gains temporary hit points equal to half the damage dealt.

Insectile Carapace:
The beast grows a chitinous shell or plates in place of its fur or scales. It gains a +2 bonus to its natural Armor Class.

Psionic Awakening:
The beast appears emaciated and its eyes become milky and white. You can cast your Circle of the Depths Spells as normal while in this form.

Quivering Flesh:
The beast's flesh quivers as if it is made of slime or viscous ooze. It can move through gaps as narrow as 1-inch wide without having to squeeze, without expending extra movement.

Unnatural Sight:
The beast has only empty sockets where its eyes would be. It cannot see normally or perceive things normally, but it gains blindsight out to a 10-foot radius.

While Tempest Domain and Circle of the Tempest are similar mechanically, they almost always serve different masters. Clerics serve gods of storms and destruction, but Tempest Druids are often found in the service of nature itself or ancient elementals.
