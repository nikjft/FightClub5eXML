      <text>Changelings can shift their forms with a thought. Many changelings use this gift as a form of artistic and emotional expression. It's also an invaluable tool for grifters, spies, and others who wish to deceive. This leads many people to treat changelings with suspicion.

      <text>Your Charisma score increases by 2, and either your Dexterity or your Intelligence increases by 1 (your choice).</text>

    <trait>
      <name>Age</name>
      <text>Changelings mature slightly faster than humans but share a similar lifespan—typically a century or less. While a Changeling can shapeshift to conceal their age, the effects of aging still catch up to them.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Alignment</name>
      <text>Changelings hate to be bound in any way, and those who follow the path of the Traveler believe that chaos and change are important aspects of life. Most tend toward pragmatic neutrality as opposed to being concerned with lofty ideals. Few Changelings embrace evil.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Size</name>
      <text>In their natural forms, Changelings average between 5 and 6 feet in height, with a slender build. Your size is Medium.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Change Appearance</name>
      <text>As an action, you can transform your appearance or revert to your natural form. You can't duplicate the appearance of a creature you've never seen, and you revert to your natural form if you die.

You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, the sound of your voice, coloration, hair length, sex, and any other distinguishing characteristics. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your game statistics change. You also can't appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you're bipedal, you can't use this trait to become quadrupedal, for instance. Your clothing and other equipment don't change in appearance, size, or shape to match your new form, requiring you to keep a few extra outfits on hand to make the most compelling disguise possible.

Even to the most astute observers, your ruse is usually indiscernible. If you rouse suspicion, or if a wary creature suspects something is amiss, you have advantage on any Charisma (Deception) check you make to avoid detection.</text>

      <name>Unsettling Visage</name>
      <text>When a creature you can see makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the roll. You must use this feature before knowing whether the attack hits or misses. Using this trait reveals your shapeshifting nature to any creature within 30 feet that can see you. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</text>

    <trait>
      <name>Divergent Persona</name>

      <text>The kalashtar are a compound race created from the union of humanity and renegade spirits from the plane of dreams | spirits called quori. Kalashtar are often seen as wise, spiritual people with great compassion for others. But there is an unmistakable alien quality to the kalashtar, as they are haunted by the conflicts of their otherworldly spirits.

      <text>The noble spirit tied to a Kalashtar drives it toward lawful and good behavior. Most Kalashtar combine self-discipline with compassion for all sentient beings, but some Kalashtar resist the virtuous influence of their spirit.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Size</name>
      <text>Your size is Medium.

To set your height and weight randomly, start with rolling a size modifier:

Size modifier = 2d6
Height = 5 feet + 4 inches + your size modifier in inches
Weight in pounds = 110 + (1d6 × your size modifier)</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Bound to Spirits</name>
      <text>Every kalashtar has a connection to a spirit of light, shared by other members of their bloodline. Kalashtar appear human, but the spiritual connection affects them in a variety of ways. Kalashtar have symmetrical, slightly angular features. The eyes of a kalashtar often glow when it is focused on a task or feeling strong emotions.

The kalashtar can't directly communicate with their quori spirits. A kalashtar might experience this relationship as a sense of instinct and inspiration, drawing on the memories of the spirit when they dream. This connection grants kalashtar minor psionic abilities, as well as protection from psychic attacks. All of these dream-spirits are virtuous, but some are warriors and others are more contemplative. Work together with the DM to determine the nature of the linked spirit. Typically, a kalashtar knows the name and nature of their spirit, but for some | for instance, an orphan kalashtar raised among outsiders | may know nothing of their spirit or the source of their psychic gifts.

The bond to the spirit can cause some kalashtar to display unusual quirks of behavior. You can roll or select a trait from the following table.

Kalashtar Quirks:
d10 | Quirk
1 | You try to understand the motives and feelings of your enemies.
2 | You prefer using telepathy over speaking aloud.
3 | You feel a strong drive to protect the innocent.
4 | You apply dream logic to mundane situations.
5 | You discuss things out loud with your quori spirit.
6 | You suppress your emotions and rely on logic.
7 | You are strongly influenced by the emotions of those around you.
8 | You prefer to find nonviolent solutions to problems whenever possible.
9 | You are driven by a warrior spirit and will fight for any noble cause.
10 | You are obsessed with Dreaming Dark conspiracies.</text>

      <name>Dual Mind</name>

      <text>You have resistance to psychic damage.</text>

    <trait>
      <name>Mind Link</name>
      <text>You can speak telepathically to any creature you can see within 60 feet of you. You don't need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic messages, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language or be telepathic itself.

As a bonus action when you're speaking telepathically to a creature, you can give that creature the ability to speak telepathically to you until the start of your next turn. To use this ability, the creature must be within 60 feet of you and able to see you.</text>
    </trait>
    <trait>
      <name>Severed from Dreams</name>
      <text>Kalashtar sleep, but they don't connect to the plane of dreams as other creatures do. Instead, their minds draw from the memories of their otherworldly spirit while they sleep. As such, you are immune to spells and other magical effects that require you to dream, like the dream spell, but not to spells and effects that put you to sleep, like the sleep spell.</text>

      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Shifters are sometimes called the weretouched, as many believe that they are the descendants of humans and lycanthropes. They are humanoids with a bestial aspect; while they cannot fully change shape they can temporarily enhance their animalistic features — a state they call shifting. Whatever their origins, shifters have evolved into a unique race. A shifter walks on the knife's edge between the wilds and the world around them. Do they embrace their primal instincts or the path of civilization?

Beasthide often signifies the bear or boar: stoic, stubborn and thick-skinned.

Stoic and solid, a beasthide shifter draws strength and stability from the beast within. Beasthide shifters are typically tied to the bear or the boar, but any creature known for its toughness could apply.

Longtooth shifters typically have lupine traits and prefer to run with a pack.

Longtooth shifters are fierce and aggressive, but they form deep bonds with their friends. Many longtooth shifters have canine traits that become more pronounced as they shift, but they might instead draw on tigers, hyenas, or other predators.

      <text>The warforged were built to fight in the Last War. The first warforged were mindless automatons, but House Cannith devoted vast resources to improving these steel soldiers. An unexpected breakthrough produced fully sentient soldiers, blending organic and inorganic materials. Warforged are made from wood and metal, but they can feel pain and emotion. Built as weapons, they must now find a purpose beyond the war. A warforged can be a steadfast ally, a cold-hearted killing machine, or a visionary in search of purpose and meaning.

As an envoy, you were designed with a certain specialized function in mind. You might be an assassin, a healer, or an entertainer, to name a few possibilities. Envoys are the rarest of the warforged subraces, and yours could be a unique design.

      <name>Integrated Protection</name>
      <text>Your body has built-in protective layers, which determine your Armor Class. You gain no benefit from wearing armor, but if you are using a shield, you apply its bonus as normal.

You can alter your body to enter different defensive modes; each time you finish a long rest, choose one mode to adopt from the Integrated Protection table, provided you meet the mode's prerequisite.

Mode | Prerequisite | Armor Class
Darkwood core (unarmored) | None | 11 + your Dexterity modifier (add proficiency bonus if proficient with light armor)
Composite plating (armor) | Medium armor proficiency | 13 + your Dexterity modifier (maximum of 2) + your proficiency bonus
Heavy plating (armor) | Heavy armor proficiency | 16 + your proficiency bonus; disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks</text>

      <name>Envoys: Specialized Design</name>
      <text>As the name implies, most Warforged were built to fight in the Last War. The vast majority of Warforged are juggernauts or skirmishers—soldiers and scouts who fought under the banner of one of the Five Nations. Warforged envoys, however, were designed to perform other functions. As an envoy, you have a skill, a tool proficiency, and a tool that's part of your body. When you make an envoy character, consider the following questions: What is your purpose? How does your skill and your tool reflect that purpose? What form does your integrated tool take? If you have embedded thieves' tools, for instance, are your fingers actually lockpicks, or can you produce keys from various parts of your body? The following characters are examples of Warforged with integrated tools.

Lute is a bard with the entertainer background; his namesake instrument folds out of his left arm.

Compass Rose is a wizard with the outlander background. A keen explorer, she uses her built-in cartographer's tools to record the paths she travels.

Masque is an infiltrator. A rogue with the charlatan background and an integrated disguise Kit, she was built to blend in and assassinate. Cannith built six Warforged of her design, and Masque has vowed to hunt down and destroy the other five.

In developing your integrated tool, remember that you must have your hands free to use it. Masque, the infiltrator mentioned above, doesn't shapeshift like a changeling; she has to manually adjust her appearance.</text>

      <text>The warforged were built to fight in the Last War. The first warforged were mindless automatons, but House Cannith devoted vast resources to improving these steel soldiers. An unexpected breakthrough produced fully sentient soldiers, blending organic and inorganic materials. Warforged are made from wood and metal, but they can feel pain and emotion. Built as weapons, they must now find a purpose beyond the war. A warforged can be a steadfast ally, a cold-hearted killing machine, or a visionary in search of purpose and meaning.

You're an imposing war machine built for close combat and raw might. You tower over your comrades; juggernaut warforged stand between 6 and 7 feet in height and can weigh up to 450 pounds.
